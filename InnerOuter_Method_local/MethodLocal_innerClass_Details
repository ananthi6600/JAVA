    Sometimes we can declare a class inside a method such type of inner classes are 
called method local inner classes. 

    We can access method local inner class only within the method where we declared 
it. That is from outside of the method we can't access. As the scope of method 
local inner classes is very less, this type of inner classes are most rarely used type 
of inner classes.
